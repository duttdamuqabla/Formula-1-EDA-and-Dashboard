# F1 Exploratory Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Objective  
This project aims to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Formula 1 (F1) racing data to uncover patterns, trends, and performance insights related to drivers, teams, circuits, and race outcomes. It also demonstrates how to integrate **SQL queries within a Jupyter environment** to enhance data handling and querying efficiency.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – interactive analysis  
- **SQLite** / **SQLAlchemy** – for relational querying within notebooks  
- **ipython-sql / sqlite3** – to run SQL queries in cells  
- **F1 Dataset** – containing race, driver, constructor, and lap-time data

## 🔄 Project Workflow  

1. **Data Import & Cleaning**
   - Load multiple CSV files (races, drivers, constructors, results, etc.)
   - Handle missing values and inconsistent formats

2. **Data Integration with SQL**
   - Store datasets in a **relational SQL database**
   - Write and execute **SQL queries** to join, filter, and aggregate data  
   - Examples include querying top drivers, filtering podium finishes, and analyzing race stats via SQL

3. **EDA and Visualization**
   - Merge SQL results with Pandas for analysis
   - Use visualizations (bar plots, heatmaps, pie charts) to highlight trends

4. **Insight Extraction**
   - Evaluate top-performing drivers, constructors, and circuits
   - Analyze historical performance and racing patterns over time

## 💡 Key Insights  
- **Lewis Hamilton**, **Sebastian Vettel**, and **Michael Schumacher** rank among the most successful drivers by wins  
- **Mercedes** and **Ferrari** lead in constructor performance  
- Certain circuits (like **Monza** and **Silverstone**) host the most F1 races
